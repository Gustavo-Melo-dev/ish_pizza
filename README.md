# ish_pizza
This project aims to simulate an order in a pizzeria where I get json to be the database to be displayed as options and according to the amount of pizzas a customer orders, your price can have a discount.

The project is divided into two parts, the backend is in the server folder and the front in src.

# Backend
Enter the server folder and run the command: "pip install fastapi uvicorn" to install the backend dependencies. Besides, it was made with MySQL and the name of the bank is "fastapi" to be able to make the connection.

After that in a separate terminal run the command: "uvicorn main:app --reload".

# Frontend
In the root folder, run the command: "npm install" to install the frontend dependencies.

After that, to run the project also in a separate terminal, run the command: "npm run dev".
